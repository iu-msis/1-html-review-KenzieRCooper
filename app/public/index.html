      <div class="col-8"> Harry Potter was born to Lily and James Potter. Two activists who were fighting against the Dark Lord, Voldemort. Voldemort was provided with notification of the whereabout of Harry's family. Harry lost his parents to Voldemort's wrath, and Voldemort believed he had finished off Harry. Except, he was alive and left with a lightining bolt on his forehead that would go on to mark him in the outside world. Snape found Harry after this tragic event and mourned the passing of Lily. He then took Harry to be raised by his Aunt and Uncle. Harry lived a mediocre life as a muggle in a small closet under the stairs. He did not know he was a famous wizard until he was notified by Hogwarts School of Magic that it was time to attend. Hagrid, Harry's guide throughout his new life, came to collect Harry and bring him to Hogwarts. Harry during his time at Hogwarts found life long friends who would fight against the return of Voldemort and eventually win. His life is documented in a series of books that are listed on the books page. These books were eventually made into movies!
